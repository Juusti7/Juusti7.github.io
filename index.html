    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">This is a picture taken in 1990 when the Voyager-1 probe was about to fly out of the solar system. <br>
    To borrow the famous words of Tyson's teacher, astrophysicist and famous science writer Carl Sagan at a degree awarding ceremony in 1996: <br>
    We successfully took this picture (from outer space). If you look at it carefully, you will see a small dot. This is it. This is our home. This is us. At this point, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of, and everyone who has ever existed, will be there for the rest of their lives.It brings together all the joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic theories, every hunter and searcher, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and farmer, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every parent, inventor and explorer. Every teacher who teaches morality, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in human history, lives here-a speck of dust suspended in the sun. <br>
    The earth is a small stage in this vast cosmic theater. Think of the blood spilled from the generals and emperors, their glory and victory only to make them a small part of the temporary master of this point. Think about the suffering of people living in one corner of this point, and another group of people living in another corner at the same point that is almost indistinguishable. How often do they misunderstand? How eager are they to kill each other? How hostile are they? <br>
    Our affectation, our self-righteousness, our delusions of how superior we are in the universe are challenged by this dim spot of light. Our planet is just a lonely particle in this dark universe. We are so humble-in this vastness, we don't get hints from anywhere to save ourselves. <br>
    ……. <br>
    It has always been said that astronomy is not only humble, but also a kind of character-building knowledge. For me, I hope there is no better demonstration than this picture of our tiny world from a distance to show the stupidity of human arrogance. For me, this emphasizes that we should treat everyone around us more kindly and compassionately, and at the same time protect and cherish this dark blue dot, the only home we know so far.</p>
